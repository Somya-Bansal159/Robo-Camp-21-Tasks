# Robo Camp 21 Tasks
Hi all!! Here, I have added my tasks which I completed for the phase 1 of Robo Camp organised by Robotics Club IIT BHU. The tasks were assigned to mark the completion of the phase.

In all the phase was three weeks long, each having subparts. These subparts covered various topics of pybullet. Some maths and physics were of course there :)
