Task 3 - 
A car is loaded. You have to develop a PID controller for that car such that it runs along the line y = 0.
The line is also visible on the plane.
Callibrate the PID gains such that car gets to the line as fast as possible and follows it without much disturbance.
Refer to the past two taks and their codes for hints.
INSTRUCTIONS -
    Select the simulation window and Press ENTER to execute
